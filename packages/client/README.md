# SCSS Language Support

Currently this is just a more accurate syntax highlighter for SCSS files.

### Roadmap to v1.0

- [ ] Code completion and Hover tooltips for `@function`s, `@mixin`s, and variables
- [ ] Support for SassDoc comments / annotations in hover tooltips
- [ ] Auto-`@use` for Sass modules
