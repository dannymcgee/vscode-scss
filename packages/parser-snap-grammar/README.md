# Parser Snapshot Grammar

This is a TextMate grammar to make the snapshots in `@sassy/lang` easier to
read by syntax highlighting them.

To see the snapshots with syntax highlighting, build & install the extension and
then reload the editor:

- `> nx build client` (in a terminal)
- `Ctrl+Shift+P > Developer: Reload Window`
