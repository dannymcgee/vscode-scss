# SCSS Language Server and VS Code Extension

This is (will eventually be) an SCSS Language Server Protocol implementation and
VS Code extension/client. Currently it just provides syntax highlighting via a
TextMate grammar.

### Dev Setup

```sh
> npm ci       # Install dependencies
> npm i -g nx  # (Recommended) Install Nx globally for easier CLI usage
> nx build     # Build and install the VS Code extension locally
```
